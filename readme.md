This was a project I worked on as the sole infrastructure developer for Hyphen LLC. This content was approved to be shared and sent to me by Matt Drouin on 03/14/23. This project consisted of two repos a front end UI built with Vue JS and the back end built with Laravel 9.x. What you see here was only 3 months of planning and development time and was never finished due to company layoffs at the end of the year 2022. 

Technologies used
Mac book pro
Docker
Jira
Confluence
git
bitbucket

Front end
Vue 3
Pinia JS

Back end
Laravel 9.x (PHP)
SQL

And probably a few more that I'm forgetting at this time.
